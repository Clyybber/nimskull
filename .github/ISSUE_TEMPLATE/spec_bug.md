<!--
The specification is super important!
Thanks for working with us and helping us confirm it.

The specification needs to be detailed and exact by nature, so we put together
the template below to help discussions relating to it.
-->

### Specification

<!--
please describe the bug:
* the issue (ambiguity, gaps, non-conformance) as best as you can describe
* any relevant specification(s) references
* if this is a simple matter of a typo it'll likely be easier a PR
-->

### Example

<!--
examples help, so here are some bases to cover:
* any example(s) demonstrating it where applicable/possible
* example(s) should be minimal so it's easy to dive deep
* reproduction of examples is key, include relevant steps like command line flags, operating system, etc
-->

```nim
# example code
```

### Actual Output

<!--
* any relevant output, crash, error messages, etc...
* we move pretty quick, so please ensure you have the latest version of the compiler
* sometimes the output isn't clear or in fact absent, please indicate the relevant aspects
-->

```
actual output goes here
```

### Expected Output

<!-- the expected output and remarks to help interpretation -->

```
expected output goes here
```
### Possible Solution

<!-- not necessary, but if you have some thoughts in mind  -->

### Additional Information

<!--
* especially if you've done any debugging, or
* have suggested solutions

we appreciate help, we're a small bunch of part-time volunteers, so please try to dig in:
* for crashes please attempt to debug: [Debugging the compiler](https://nim-works.github.io/nimskull/intern.html#debugging-the-compiler)
* for suspected regressions: [Bisecting for regressions](https://nim-works.github.io/nimskull/intern.html#bisecting-for-regressions)
-->

### References

<!--
* related issues, PRs, discussions
* any additional or relevant links for people to better understand things and work with you
