<!--
Before writing a todo:
* use chat, discussions, and projects to evolve the idea
* this means that todo artifacts will be easier for others to pickup

When writing a todo, consider this structure:
* couple sentences or few bullet points describing what it is when done
* couple sentences of why it's good
* maybe a task list
* Q&A or discussion summary section gathering any relevant bits from chat, discussions, etc
* links to relevant discussion and/or associate with a project
