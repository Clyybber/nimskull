## Tips for pull requests
* use chat, discussions, etc... to refine an idea for big and/or impactful changes
* open them relatively early in draft mode and get regular feedback
* add notes for reviewers and yourself as you go, so it's easy to maintain context
* refine the pull request message over time

<!--
## Finalizing a PR:

### title:
* reads like a short changelog line

### body:
* describe the current behaviour
* describe why this particular approach
* if it's breaking, migration steps
* note any follow-on work

### content:
* leave code better than you found it, add docs, tests, etc
-->
