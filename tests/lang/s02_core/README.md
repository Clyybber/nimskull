# What Belongs Here?

This is the core of the language, but prior to the higher level features, this
would be what one might use to write a bootstrap Nim compiler which does not
possess all the features of Nim.

Presently the following should be covered in later sections, possibly in this 
order as a representation of lowerings:
- compiletime expression evaluation
- for loops
- inline iterators
- overloading
- generics
- first class iterators
- converters
- type tags
- effects
- destructors
- templates
- macros
- for loop macros

The above list will evolve as we gain clarity of how these features should
be decomposed and how they should interact with one another.
