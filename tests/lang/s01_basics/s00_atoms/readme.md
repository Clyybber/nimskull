# Atoms

This directory contains specifications for basic language components:

- What is an expression
- What is a statement
- What is "compile time"

For a lot of these, it is difficult to demonstrate without using
concepts from subsequent specification tests; but, it was decided to put them
as a first entry in the specification. When more "advanced" entries are used,
these should be referenced.
