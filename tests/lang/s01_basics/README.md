# What Belongs Here?

Here we have tests for the very simple parts of the language, that we often
would not think to test. Mostly this captures minor trivia around:
- comments
- literals
- if statements
- etc

Things that we barely think about -- if it fits better somewhere else put it
there. This is a a place for the things too small, rather than too big and fit
nowhere else.
